            <h2>History</h2>
            <div class="History">
            <p>Founded in the early 2000s by a group of passionate outdoor
                enthusiasts, Rapids Adventures began with a single raft and a vision
                to share the thrill of white water rafting. The company quickly gained
                popularity for its commitment to safety and unforgettable experiences
                on the river. As demand grew, Rapids Adventures expanded its fleet and
                introduced guided tours for all skill levels, attracting both families
                and adrenaline-seekers alike. Recognizing the need for environmental
                stewardship, the company launched conservation initiatives to protect
                the natural beauty that supports its adventures. Over the years,
                Rapids Adventures has become a beloved fixture in the community,
                fostering a culture of inclusivity and camaraderie among guests.
                Today, the company remains dedicated to delivering exceptional rafting
                experiences while prioritizing safety and sustainability for future
                generations.</p>
